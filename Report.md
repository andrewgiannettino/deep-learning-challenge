What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
the target variable is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column.

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
the features would be the rest of the columns in the dataframe

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
The vatiables that should be removed are ein, status, and name.

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
I used 10 hidden nodes layer 1, 20 hidden nodes layer 2, and 30 hidden nodes layer 3. This is because based upon various attempts this was the most accurate set I could achieve. 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
I was not able to achieve the target

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
I added hiiden node layers, dropout rates, and different activation modes. 

SUMMARY
My model was around 73% percent accurate. This was the highest accuracy I could manage with the data. Without doing more cleaning It is hard to tell wether or not this data has enough of a correlation to achieve much higher.
